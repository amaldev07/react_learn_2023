1. Run the command 
npx create-react-app my-app
 to create a new React project named "my-app" using the create-react-app tool. This will create a new directory called "my-app" with a basic React project structure.

2. Run the command npm install -g create-react-app. This will install create-react-app globally on your computer.

3. Navigate to the "my-app" directory by running cd my-app.

4. Run the command npm start to start the development server. This should open a new browser window with your React app running.
